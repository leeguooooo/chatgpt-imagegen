# chatgpt-imagegen

**English** | [中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

**Generate images using your ChatGPT subscription — no `OPENAI_API_KEY` needed.**

A tiny, zero-dependency Python CLI (and AI-agent skill) that talks directly to ChatGPT's internal `image_generation` tool. If you already pay for ChatGPT Plus / Pro / Team, you can already generate images — this just exposes that capability on the command line and to any AI agent.

```bash
chatgpt-imagegen "a watercolor cat sitting on a windowsill" -o cat.png
# -> saved: cat.png  (812,344 bytes)  size=1024x1024  quality=medium
```

No server. No proxy. No API key. One Python file, stdlib only.

## Why this exists

OpenAI offers image generation in two completely separate ways:

| Path | What you pay | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Direct API** (`/v1/images/generations`) | per-image, on top of an `OPENAI_API_KEY` | curl / OpenAI SDK / etc. |
| **ChatGPT subscription** (Plus / Pro / Team) | flat monthly fee | ChatGPT web/desktop app, or the Codex CLI's built-in `image_gen` |

The **subscription path is invisible** to people who don't use the Codex CLI. It runs on ChatGPT's internal `backend-api/codex/responses` endpoint as a Responses-API tool, authenticated by the OAuth token written into `~/.codex/auth.json` when you run `codex login`.

`chatgpt-imagegen` exposes that capability on the command line and to any AI agent — with **two backends** that hit different parts of your subscription.

## Backends

The same subscription meters two separate buckets, and which one you spend depends on *where* the image is generated:

| Backend | How it generates | Bucket spent | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`web`** | Drives your already-logged-in ChatGPT **browser** (via [`agent-browser-stealth`](https://github.com/leeguooooo/agent-browser-stealth), the `agent-browser`/`abs` command) and generates in a normal chat — the same surface as typing in the app. The *stealth* fork's real-Chrome connect clears Cloudflare + the sentinel proof-of-work a plain/headless client can't. | **ChatGPT conversation** — does *not* touch your metered **Codex-usage** limit. | A logged-in chatgpt.com browser + `agent-browser-stealth`. |
| **`codex`** | Headless POST to `backend-api/codex/responses`, reusing `~/.codex/auth.json`. | **Codex-usage** (the metered bucket). | `codex login`. |

**Default is `auto`**: it tries `web` first (to spare your Codex-usage limit) and falls back to `codex` only when no logged-in browser is reachable. If neither is set up, it tells you how to fix both. Force one with `--backend web` / `--backend codex`, or set `CHATGPT_IMAGEGEN_BACKEND`.

> Why two? The consumer ChatGPT surface sits behind Cloudflare + a sentinel proof-of-work that only a real browser passes — that's why `web` drives a browser instead of calling an endpoint. The `codex/responses` surface has no such wall (it's the Codex CLI's sanctioned API), which is why `codex` can run headless — at the cost of billing the Codex-usage bucket.

### Which backend for which machine

The split follows what each machine actually has — and `auto` picks correctly on its own:

| Machine | Has a logged-in ChatGPT browser? | Use | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Your laptop / desktop** (interactive) | Yes — Chrome is already open and signed in | **`web`** | Spares your Codex-usage limit; it's just the app you already use. |
| **A server / headless agent box** (e.g. a bot runner) | No — no GUI browser, no parked chatgpt.com session | **`codex`** | Headless, no browser needed; the natural fit for an automation box that already ran `codex login`. |

So the `web` backend is **not** "better" everywhere — it needs a real, logged-in browser on that machine. A headless server has no such browser, so `auto` there will (correctly) fall back to `codex`. Making a server use `web` would mean running a persistent headed Chrome (with the stealth extension, kept logged in to chatgpt.com) — possible, but rarely worth it when that box already has `codex`.

**The account caveat:** the `web` backend generates under **whatever account that browser is logged into** — which may differ from the account in `~/.codex/auth.json`. If you want a specific subscription's bucket, make sure the browser is signed in to that account.

## Install

You need Python 3.10+, a ChatGPT subscription (Plus / Pro / Team), and **at least one backend set up**:

- **For the default `web` backend:** [`agent-browser-stealth`](https://github.com/leeguooooo/agent-browser-stealth) installed (provides the `agent-browser` / `abs` command) and its extension connected to a Chrome that's signed in to chatgpt.com. The *stealth* fork specifically is what passes Cloudflare's bot-detection. (Spares your Codex-usage limit.)
- **For the `codex` backend:** the OpenAI Codex CLI (`npm i -g @openai/codex`) and a one-time `codex login`.

`auto` mode uses whichever is available, preferring `web`. Setting up both gives you the seamless fallback.

#### Setting up the `web` backend (agent-browser-stealth)

**What it is:** [`agent-browser-stealth`](https://github.com/leeguooooo/agent-browser-stealth) is a stealth fork of the `agent-browser` CLI. It drives your **real, already-logged-in Chrome** through a browser extension + native-messaging relay — so requests carry a genuine browser's TLS fingerprint and cookies and pass Cloudflare's bot-detection + ChatGPT's sentinel proof-of-work. A plain headless automation client can't do this; that's why the `web` backend needs the stealth fork specifically.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/leeguooooo/agent-browser-stealth
- **Chrome extension:** [agent-browser-stealth on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/agent-browser-stealth/knfcmbamhjmaonkfnjhldjedeobeafmk)

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI (no npm, no token — installs the `agent-browser` / `abs` command)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeguooooo/agent-browser-stealth/main/install.sh | sh

# 2. Register the native-messaging host
agent-browser extension install

# 3. Add the extension to Chrome (Web Store link above), then restart Chrome
# 4. In that Chrome, sign in to https://chatgpt.com
```

Once the extension is connected, `chatgpt-imagegen` (web backend) drives that real Chrome automatically — no remote-debugging prompts, no separate browser.

### Option A — for AI agents (recommended)

Install via [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh) — works with Claude Code, Codex Agent, Cursor, OpenClaw, etc.:

```bash
npx skills add leeguooooo/chatgpt-imagegen -g
```

This drops both the agent instructions (`SKILL.md`) and the CLI itself into your agent's skill directory. Just ask any compatible agent: *"画一张 xxx"* / *"generate a hero banner for the README"*.

### Option B — standalone CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leeguooooo/chatgpt-imagegen
cd chatgpt-imagegen
chmod +x chatgpt-imagegen
./chatgpt-imagegen "a tiny pixel-art mushroom"
```

Or put it on your `$PATH`:

```bash
sudo install chatgpt-imagegen /usr/local/bin/chatgpt-imagegen
```

That's the entire setup. No `pip install`, no virtualenv, no daemon.

## Usage

```bash
chatgpt-imagegen "<prompt>" [options]
```

| Flag | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--backend` | `auto` | `auto` \| `web` \| `codex`. `auto` prefers web (spares Codex-usage), falls back to codex if no logged-in browser. See [Backends](#backends). Also `CHATGPT_IMAGEGEN_BACKEND`. |
| `--session` | `imagegen-<pid>` | *(web)* Reuse a named `agent-browser` Chrome tab group across runs. |
| `--keep-tab` | off | *(web)* Leave the ChatGPT tab open after generating (default closes it). |
| `-o`, `--out PATH` | `assets/generated/<slug>.<ext>` | Output file; parent dirs created. A warning is printed when the suffix and `--format` disagree (e.g. `-o foo.jpg --format png`). |
| `--size` | `auto` | `auto` or any `WIDTHxHEIGHT`. Verified working: `1024x1024`, `1024x1536`, `1536x1024`. Larger sizes are forwarded as-is. |
| `--format` | `png` | `png` \| `jpeg` \| `webp` |
| `--model` | `gpt-5.5` | Chat model that hosts the `image_generation` tool |
| `--timeout` | `300` | **Total wall-clock budget** (seconds) for the whole request. Large/detailed images can take 2–3 min. |
| `--stall-timeout` | `120` | Max seconds of silence (no data from backend) before declaring a **stall** — caught well before the total budget. Clamped to `--timeout`. |
| `--quiet` | off | Print **only** the saved path on stdout (perfect for agent pipelines). Progress still streams to stderr — use `--no-progress` to silence it. |
| `--no-progress` | off | Suppress the stderr progress timeline (errors still print). |
| `-V`, `--version` | — | Print the CLI version (`chatgpt-imagegen 0.3.0`) and exit. |

Examples:

```bash
# Default → assets/generated/<slugified-prompt>.png
chatgpt-imagegen "watercolor cat"

# Pick the path
chatgpt-imagegen "logo for a coffee shop, vector style" -o brand/logo.png --size 1024x1024

# Landscape hero banner
chatgpt-imagegen "moody mountain sunset" -o web/hero.png --size 1536x1024

# Use in a shell pipeline
OUT=$(chatgpt-imagegen "icon" --quiet)
echo "saved to $OUT"
```

## AI-agent skill

Drop the repo into any AI-agent's skill directory (Claude Code, Codex Agent, Cursor, etc.):

```bash
# Claude Code example
npx skills add leeguooooo/chatgpt-imagegen -g
# or symlink directly into ~/.claude/skills/
```

The bundled [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) tells the agent when to invoke it, sizing recipes, where to save outputs, and how to handle errors. Just ask any compatible agent: *"画一张 xxx 给我看看"* / *"generate a hero banner for the README"*.

## What works / what doesn't

| Parameter | Subscription path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--size` | ✅ honoured | `auto` or any `WIDTHxHEIGHT`; backend rejects sizes it doesn't support. Verified working: `auto`, `1024x1024`, `1024x1536`, `1536x1024`. Larger sizes (`2048x*`, `3840x*`) are forwarded as-is — the backend may accept or reject depending on subscription tier. |
| `--format` | ✅ honoured | `png` / `jpeg` / `webp` |
| Quality | ⚠️ chosen by the model | The script does not expose a `--quality` flag because the subscription path does not expose reliable quality control — the backend has been observed picking `low` or `medium` on its own and ignoring or downgrading any request for `high`. Use the official `/v1/images/generations` API with `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you need explicit quality control. |
| `background: transparent` | ❌ not supported on subscription | needs API-key path with `gpt-image-1.5` |
| Image edits (`/v1/images/edits`) | ❌ not exposed yet | open an issue if you need this |
| Speed | typically 15–60 s, occasionally 2–3 min for large/detailed images | streamed end-to-end; a per-phase timeline prints to stderr so you can see it working |

## Concurrency

You can fire multiple `chatgpt-imagegen` processes in parallel — the ChatGPT subscription backend handles concurrent `image_generation` calls fine. Measured on a Plus account, **4 simultaneous requests all returned 200**, total wall time ≈ slowest single (~27s), no serialization, no 429s.

```bash
# Fire 4 in parallel from a shell:
for p in apple sky tree sun; do
  chatgpt-imagegen "a tiny $p icon, flat vector, white background" \
    -o "icons/$p.png" --quiet &
done
wait
```

Caveat: subscription quota is shared with the ChatGPT web app and Codex CLI. Don't run sustained batches (>10 images/min) — you'll eventually hit per-day rate limits. For bulk batches, use the official `/v1/images/generations` API with an `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## When NOT to use this — use the API instead

If any of these apply, this tool is the wrong fit:

- You want **true `quality=high`** or **native transparent backgrounds** — both require the official `/v1/images/generations` API with an `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- You're building a **production service** that serves images to end users — using your personal ChatGPT subscription for that violates OpenAI's ToS and burns the quota you use for actual ChatGPT.
- You need **deterministic per-call billing** that you can pass through to customers — the API has that, the subscription doesn't.
- You want **>10 images per minute** sustained — subscription rate limits are tighter than the API.

For those cases, just call OpenAI's official endpoint:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-image-2","prompt":"...","size":"1024x1024"}'
```

## Want this as an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API?

If you need an **HTTP gateway** (so any OpenAI SDK / LangChain / OpenWebUI / Dify / your-own-app can `POST /v1/chat/completions` and get an image back) — use the sister project:

➡️ **[leeguooooo/agent-cli-to-api](https://github.com/leeguooooo/agent-cli-to-api)** — exposes the same ChatGPT-subscription `image_generation` tool as an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` server. Pick that one when you want network-callable, multi-client, or remote-host usage.

| You want | Use |

## How it works (technical)

### `web` backend (default)

Drives your logged-in browser via `agent-browser-stealth` so generation runs on the consumer ChatGPT surface — which a headless client can't reach, because it sits behind Cloudflare bot-detection **and** a sentinel proof-of-work (`backend-api/sentinel/chat-requirements` + an in-page `sentinel/sdk.js` that computes the token). A real browser passes both transparently. The flow:

```
chatgpt-imagegen --backend web
   │
   ├── agent-browser open https://chatgpt.com/   (a *regular* chat — Temporary Chat disables the image tool)
   ├── type the prompt with real keystrokes        (ProseMirror/React composer ignores DOM-only `fill`)
   ├── poll the page: wait until streaming stops AND a new <img> asset is stable
   └── fetch the asset bytes in-page (credentials:'include') → base64 → save
       (the signed estuary/content URL is authorized by the browser's own cookies)
```

No tokens leave the browser. One chat is left in your history per run.

### `codex` backend

The Codex CLI's built-in `image_gen` skill is implemented as a native Responses-API tool:

```jsonc
// Codex CLI's request to chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses:
{
  "model": "gpt-5.5",
  "tools": [{"type": "image_generation"}],
  "input": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type":"input_text","text":"draw a cat"}]}],
  // ...
}
```

The server replies with an SSE stream whose `response.output_item.done` events carry an `item.type === "image_generation_call"` payload, where `item.result` is base64 PNG. `chatgpt-imagegen` does exactly that:

```
chatgpt-imagegen
   │
   ├── reads ~/.codex/auth.json     (OAuth access_token, account_id, refresh_token)
   ├── reads ~/.codex/version.json  (codex CLI version → matches server expectations)
   │
   └── POST https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses
       headers: Authorization, version, originator, session_id, …
       body:    tools: [image_generation]
       │
       └── SSE stream
           ├── response.image_generation_call.in_progress    → "queued"
           ├── response.image_generation_call.generating      → "generating"
           ├── response.image_generation_call.partial_image   → "receiving image (partial N)"
           ├── response.output_item.done  ← item.result = base64 PNG
           └── response.completed
```

If the OAuth token has expired the script auto-refreshes via `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token` (using the refresh_token already stored by `codex login`) and persists the new token back to `~/.codex/auth.json`.
